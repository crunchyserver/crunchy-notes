This is a project for android app development learning!

The objective is to take the existing Notepad example app and change the design and behaviour, to 
learn slowly about android apps.

What comes out at the end may be a useful app, but may not. I will use it, but the rest of the world 
may prefer something else!

Released under the same apache license as the original example code, for simplicity.

Enjoy.
